# android-recycle-classwork

Create a recycle view that lists at least 5 musicians. It should have the musician's name, album, and song name all retrieved from the stings.xml file along with a play button for each item. When the play button is pressed display a toast message that says "Playback Started".

Extra Work:
The play button should cycle through the messages "Playback Started" and "Playback Paused".
